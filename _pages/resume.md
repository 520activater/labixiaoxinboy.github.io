# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Group influence recognition based on causal inference and graph neural network  
*8/2024 – 6/2026*  
- Supported by the **National Undergraduate Training Program on Innovation and Entrepreneurship** *(Second PI)*.
- Developed a novel framework combining casual learning theory and graph neural networks to evaluate group influence in social networks, enhancing robustness and interpretability.
- Reproduced five research papers, completed Stanford’s CS224W course, and studied *Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer*.
- Currently optimizing feature extraction methods and ranking tasks.

### Identification of hazardous targets in submarine pipeline areas  
*8/2022 – 6/2024*  
- Supported by the **Shaanxi Province Undergraduate Training Program on Innovation and Entrepreneurship** *(2/4)*.
- Built a lightweight detection model using the YOLOv5 algorithm to identify hazardous objects in degraded underwater images, applying denoising and enhancement techniques.
- Deployed the model on NVIDIA edge computing boards after completing Stanford’s CS231N course as a core team member.
