Hi! My name is Zhou Yukai, and you can also call me Five. I am from Changsha, Hunan. I attended [The High School Attached to Hunan Normal University](https://www.hnsdfz.org/) for my high school education. Currently, I am a junior student at [the School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/).

My advisor is Associate Professor [Zhou Kuang](https://kuangzhou.github.io/), and I am currently working under his guidance on a national-level undergraduate innovation project.

Feel free to reach out to me at zhouyukai@mail.nwpu.edu.cn. I look forward to connecting and exchanging ideas!
